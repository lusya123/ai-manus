"""Structured output contracts between agents and the LLM.

Each model backs an :class:`app.domain.services.tools.base.OutputTool` that
the model calls through native function calling to submit structured results
(plans, step reports, final deliveries). Schemas are derived from these
Pydantic models, and arguments are validated against them with self-repair on
failure — no JSON format instructions live in prompts anymore.
