"""Celery application shared by the API process (producer) and workers (consumer).

The broker defaults to the same Redis instance used for streams/caching, and
can be overridden with the CELERY_BROKER_URL setting. Results are not stored
in a Celery result backend: task state is tracked in Redis metadata keys
(see celery_task.py), and all agent events flow through Redis Streams.
